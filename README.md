# QM-INFINITE-RAMPED-WELL
**ABSTRACT**

A numerical integration approach to solving the time-independent Schrodinger equation for an electron bound in a ramped infinite square well potential. The first three energy eigenstates are found with their respective energies, $E_1 = {0.5}{eV}$, $E_2={0.87}{eV}$, and $E_3={1.18}{eV}$.
